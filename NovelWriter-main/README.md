# NovelWriter

## Description

NovelWriter is a comprehensive Python application designed to assist authors in writing novels and short stories across **multiple genres** by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a GUI-based interface built with Tkinter for managing novel parameters, generating universe lore, outlining story structure, planning scenes, and writing chapter prose. The application now features an advanced agentic framework with multi-agent orchestration and a multi-level review system for quality control, plus a unified multi-backend LLM interface that can route requests to either hosted APIs or local CLI tools.

- **Fantasy** (High Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Urban Fantasy, Sword and Sorcery, Mythic Fantasy, Fairy Tale)
- **Historical Fiction** (Ancient History, Medieval, Renaissance, Colonial America, Civil War Era, World War Era)
- **Horror** (Gothic Horror, Psychological Horror, Supernatural Horror, Body Horror, Cosmic Horror, Slasher)
- **Mystery** (Cozy Mystery, Hard-boiled Detective, Police Procedural, Amateur Sleuth, Legal Thriller, Forensic Mystery)
- **Romance** (Contemporary Romance, Historical Romance, Paranormal Romance, Romantic Suspense, Regency Romance, Western Romance)
- **Thriller** (Espionage Thriller, Psychological Thriller, Action Thriller, Techno-Thriller, Medical Thriller, Legal Thriller)

The application features a dynamic LLM model and backend selector, allowing users to choose between **API backends** and **local CLI tools**, and to pick specific models for API usage. Currently configured models include:

*   OpenAI GPT-5, GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini
*   Claude 4.5 Sonnet
*   Gemini 2.5 Pro
*   *(You can add/remove models by configuring `ai_helper.py`)*

Deprecated models:
*   OpenAI o1, o1-mini o3, o4-mini
*   Gemini 1.5, 2.0
*   Claude 3.5, 3.7 Sonnet

Running this code requires API keys for the specific LLMs you intend to use (e.g., an **OpenAI API key** for GPT models, a **Google AI API key** for Gemini models, **Anthropic API Key** for Claude models). These keys should be stored in a `.env` file in the project's root directory.

In addition, NovelWriter can talk to several **local CLI tools** via a unified LLM interface:

- `codex` — Codex CLI providing zero-cost GPT-5 style completions
- `gemini` — Gemini CLI for local access to Gemini 2.5 models
- `claude` — Claude Code CLI for local Claude-style completions

If these binaries are available on your `PATH`, NovelWriter can route LLM traffic through them instead of the hosted APIs, letting you mix and match cost, latency, and capability per project.

Full automation is available, however the outputs can also serve as a starting point that can be further refined by the author.

Want to see what NovelWriter can create? Check out the [**NovelWriter-Examples**](https://github.com/EdwardAThomson/NovelWriter-Examples) repository, which showcases complete novels and short stories generated using this application.

**Featured Examples:**
- **"Echoes of Terra Nova"** - 52,212 words (Space Opera, generated with OpenAI o1-preview)
- **"Starbound Legacy: The Awakening"** - 50,339 words (Space Opera, generated with GPT-4o)

Each example includes the complete workflow outputs showing all intermediate generation steps, from initial parameters through to final prose, demonstrating how the structured approach produces coherent long-form fiction.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EdwardAThomson/NovelWriter.git
    cd NovelWriter
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
It might easiest to open the files in an IDE and let it handle virtual environments automatically.
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * (or `pip install openai python-dotenv google-generativeai anthropic`)
    
4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your API keys to this file in the following format:
        
        ```dotenv
        OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
        GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_api_key_here'
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_anthropic_api_key_here'
        ```
    *   Replace the placeholder text with your actual keys.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 🔧 Utility Scripts

### `combine.py` -- build the novel file

Located in the root directory, this script is used to combine all generated chapter markdown files (typically found in `current_work/chapters/`) into a single markdown file. The output file is named after the novel's title (if found in `parameters.txt`) or defaults to `combined_novel.md`, and is saved within the `current_work/chapters/` directory. This is useful for creating a complete manuscript from individual chapter files.

## 🚀 The Generation Process

NovelWriter offers two complementary approaches to story generation:

### Traditional GUI-Based Workflow

The step-by-step approach using the UI tabs:

1.  **Novel Parameters (`core/gui/parameters.py`):** 
    * Select genre, subgenre, story length, structure
    * Configure gender balance and genre-specific options
    * Set up basic story parameters manually

2.  **Generate Lore (`core/gui/lore.py`):**
    * Generate factions/organizations with specialized generators
    * Create characters with detailed backgrounds and relationships
    * Build comprehensive world-building elements
    * Generate narrative backstories with genre-appropriate context

3.  **Story Structure (`core/gui/story_structure.py`):**
    * Create character and faction arcs
    * Generate high-level story structure using selected framework
    * Develop detailed plot outlines for each act/section

4.  **Scene Planning (`core/gui/scene_plan.py`):**
    * Generate chapter outlines based on story structure
    * Create detailed scene plans with character interactions

5.  **Write Chapters (`core/gui/chapter_writing.py`):**
    * Generate prose for each scene manually
    * Review and improve chapters individually

### Agentic Orchestrated Workflow

The fully automated approach using the agentic framework:

1.  **Story Generation Orchestrator (`agents/orchestration/story_generation_orchestrator.py`):**
    * Coordinates the entire story generation process
    * Manages workflow between specialized agents
    * Handles decision-making and quality control

2.  **Consistency Agent (`agents/consistency/consistency_agent.py`):**
    * Ensures character and world-building consistency
    * Tracks plot threads and narrative elements
    * Validates story against established lore

3.  **Quality Control Agent (`agents/quality/quality_agent.py`):**
    * Analyzes content for coherence, pacing, and prose quality
    * Provides improvement recommendations
    * Ensures quality standards are maintained

4.  **Chapter Writing Agent (`agents/writing/chapter_writing_agent.py`):**
    * Automates chapter writing with scene-by-scene generation
    * Performs multi-level quality reviews:
      * Scene-level: Quality, word count, issues, strengths
      * Chapter-level: Coherence, pacing, character development
      * Batch-level: Consistency, progression, style
    * Tracks quality trends and applies retry logic
    * Generates quality dashboards with detailed metrics

### Original Version

The original version was created as part of NaNoGenMo 2024 ([**completed**](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2024/issues/31)). The first version of the code was pushed to a different repo as I lost access to my GitHub account (fixed!), please find the original repo here: [NovelWriter](https://github.com/edthomson/NovelWriter). That code was not fully automated, but it did generate a 52,000-word novel (Echoes of Terra Nova).
